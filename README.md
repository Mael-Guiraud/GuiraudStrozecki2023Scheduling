The two folders correspond to the experiment of the sections 6.1 and 6.1 of the paper "Scheduling periodic messages on a shared link".

You need to have gcc and gnuplot installed on your OS.
To launch an experiment, you can edit the parameters in the DEFINES at the top of the C files, and launch the experiment with a simple "make". A pdf file with the performance of the algorithms will be generated in the folder.
